## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [Css Modules](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-a-css-modules-stylesheet/) - For styles
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

This project aided me in gaining useful practice with the the use of the NextJS framework. I was particularly able to get familiar with the following concepts:

- File-based routing
- API routes
- Static pre-generation
- Server-side rendering

Also, I was able to practice collection of data from form submission with MongoDB.
